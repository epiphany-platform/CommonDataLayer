# Query Service
Each Query Service serves a common set of queries, and translates those into their respective database's query language.
Two query-services are present: one for timeseries databases, and one for documents.

### Technical Description

The query service (`QS` or for example for postgresql its `QSPG`), is responsible for querying data from specific repository. It offers two paths that can be accessed:
First path depends on type of repo

### Communication
Communication to query service is done through [gRPC][grpc] based on two [endpoints][proto] of querying for data by `SCHEMA_ID` or multiple `OBJECT_ID`s. Query service communicates with multiple databases such as postgresql, druid, victoria metrics. Query service also communicates with [schema registry][schema-registry]. 

Interacts with:
- Druid
- Postgresql
- VictoriaMetrics (accidentally also Prometheus)
- Sled
- Troika
- .. any similar grpc-able repo

Query methods:
- GRPC (req-response)

Communication protocols:
- database specific
